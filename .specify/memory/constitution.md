# Project Constitution for Next-JS-Landing-Page-Starter-Template

## 1. Governance

- **Constitution Version**: 1.0.0
- **Ratification Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Last Amended Date**: 2025-10-01

### Amendment Process

Amendments to this constitution require a clear proposal and justification. Changes will be recorded with an increment to the constitution version according to semantic versioning rules.

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes, such as removing or fundamentally redefining a principle.
- **MINOR**: Adding a new principle or significantly expanding guidance.
- **PATCH**: Minor clarifications, wording fixes, or typo corrections.

## 2. Principles

### Principle 1: Simplicity and Minimalism

- **Rule**: We write the least amount of code and create the least amount of documentation necessary to deliver a working, maintainable solution. Every line of code and every sentence of documentation adds to the maintenance burden.
- **Rationale**: To minimize operational costs and complexity, making the project easier to understand, maintain, and contribute to.

### Principle 2: Fail Fast

- **Rule**: We use assertions and proactive error handling to ensure that potential issues are caught at the earliest possible moment. Anything that can fail later should be validated upfront to fail now.
- **Rationale**: Early failure detection reduces debugging time and prevents bugs from propagating into production, leading to more robust and reliable software.

### Principle 3: Leverage Existing Solutions

- **Rule**: We MUST prioritize using existing, well-maintained packages and components over building our own. Custom solutions are only considered when no suitable third-party option exists.
- **Rationale**: This reduces development time, maintenance overhead, and allows us to benefit from the expertise and testing of the wider community.

### Principle 4: Clarity and Self-Documenting Code

- **Rule**: Code MUST be written to be as clear and understandable as possible. Function names, variable names, and overall structure should make the code's purpose self-evident without needing extensive comments.
- **Rationale**: Clear code is easier to debug, maintain, and refactor. It lowers the barrier for new contributors to understand the codebase.

### Principle 5: Concise and Effective Documentation

- **Rule**: The `README.md` and other essential documentation MUST be short and to the point. They should provide all the necessary information for a user to get started quickly without being verbose.
- **Rationale**: Minimal documentation is easier to keep up-to-date and more likely to be read by users and contributors. It aligns with our principle of low maintenance overhead.
